# CADStock
CADStock is sincerely one of my best creations.

It was designed for following the Stock of a Music Shop, but actually can be configured for any industries that sell items.

Couldn't compile the last version cause it use a MSCOMCTL.OCX outdated, but can be compiled with a bit of work.

A working version of the application (Not the last one, but one of them) can be found in "Programa Facturacion.rar" - You should uncompress it and change "datosvacios.mdb" to "datos.mbd".

Really a work I was proud of.

<b>Should have installed Dependencies (Or VB6) in order for it to work. Also Microsoft detect it as a false positive in some computers.</b>
